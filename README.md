# Borehole-signal-analysis
A script for engineering borehole analysis that calculates spectral top/bottom ratios and top/bottom crosscorrelations.

This is another old Python 2.7 script I wrote for my MSc project in 2016. It accesses a database of datafiles (SAC format) and performs signal analysis, outputting a summary figure.
